# PHP File Opening Error: Handling Nonexistent Files

This repository demonstrates a common PHP error: attempting to open a non-existent file without robust error handling.  The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a more robust solution.

The issue lies in the lack of explicit checks and proper handling for the case where `fopen()` fails to open the file.  Improper error handling can lead to unexpected program behavior, such as silent failures or crashes.

The solution demonstrates better error handling using a combination of `fopen()`'s return value and error reporting functions for improved reliability and maintainability.
